            <h3>Here's a timeline of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer:</h3>
            <div id="tri-div">
                <ul>
                    <li><span>1904</span> - Born in New York City, U.S</li>
                    <li><span>1911</span> - Entered the Ethical Culture Society School.</li>
                    <li><span>1922</span> - Entered Harvard College at the age of 18.</li>
                    <li><span>1925</span> - Graduated from Harvard with a Bachelor of Arts, summa cum laude, after only three years of study.</li>
                    <li><span>1924</span> - wrote to Ernest Rutherford requesting permission to work at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge, though Bridgman's letter of recommendation.</li>
                    <li><span>1926</span> - Left Cambridge for the University of Göttingen to study under Max Born.</li>
                    <li><span>1927</span> - Obtained his Doctor of Philosophy degree at age 23, supervised by Max Born.</li>
                    <li><span>1936</span> - Became a full Professor at  University of California, Berkeley.</li>
                    <li><span>1942</span> - Recruited to work on the Manhattan Project.</li>
                    <li><span>1943</span> - Appointed director of the project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons. His leadership and scientific expertise were instrumental in the project's success.</li>
                    <li><span>1945</span> -Present at the first test of the atomic bomb, Trinity. In August 1945, the weapons were used against Japan in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict.</li>
                    <li><span>1947</span> - Became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and chaired the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.</li>
                    <li><span>1949</span> - Opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb during a 1949–1950 governmental debate on the question and subsequently took positions on defense-related issues that provoked the ire of some U.S. government and military factions. During the second Red Scare, Oppenheimer's stances, together with his past associations with the Communist Party USA, led to the revocation of his security clearance following a 1954 security hearing. This effectively ended his access to the government's atomic secrets and thus his career as a nuclear physicist. Stripped also of his direct political influence, Oppenheimer continued to lecture, write, and work in physics.</li>
                    <li><span>1963</span> - Awarded the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation.</li>
                    <li><span>1967</span> - Died in his sleep at his home in Princeton, aged 62 years.</li>
                </ul>
